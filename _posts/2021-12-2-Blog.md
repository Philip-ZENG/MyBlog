I am in the kind of bad situation that I feel I am lack of confidence, and I do not want to meet others or communicate with others because I maybe left behind by them and I don't like that kind of feelings.

Whenever we are in a good condition, we should think about the future times that we may be get stuck in trouble, and make early preparations and arrangements for it.

We should probably make schedules and follow strictly with the schedule. Or at least we should record what we did in the day that has just passed, or otherwise we would easily get into the case that we finish nothing in that day and the time has just pass by, probably spent on those meaningless entertainment on videos, news and other stuffs on the inter net. Bad!

I am not sure whether recording our time usage will make our life more organized or just even increasing our stress. Probably they come at the same time with each other. Since you are frequently reminded about the task to be finished, you will definitely feel stress but that will also push us on moving forward and have a better control of our time management and behaviors.
