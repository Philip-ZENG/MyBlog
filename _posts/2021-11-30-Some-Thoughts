I finally retired from Shaw Collge Resident Student Association. I has the kind of feeling that, I have devoted a lot of my time to something meaningless.
I appriciate all the greart partners and great friends I met during this journey. I am so grateful that I can have the chance to meet you, to know you and work with you.
I once hold the grand vision and passion of making SCRSA a great organization, I made many plans and think about the path to achieve them all. I truely appreciate our
SCRSA partners, who gives me supports and together we bring the vision raised by me to reality : he project-X series has go to the sixth section now.
