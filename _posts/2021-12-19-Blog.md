Videos and games are the things that will distract us from doing your jobs, however, it at most of the time works for those who are not clear about their target, and weak and hesitating in their mind. People would get lost in game playing when they do not have a target and games are just such a thing that can give short term and immediate feedback in joy and fulfillment, so it will trap these weak minded people and make them get addicted to it. This is how we should be fully aware of, and should pay full attention to.
