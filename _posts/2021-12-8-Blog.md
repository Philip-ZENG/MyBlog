## About my current status

Human who is going alone can sometimes be weak mentally, their sense of laziness may take charge, and they may become afraid of facing challenges because they felt hopeless. With the support of friends and the kind of environment and atmosphere created by outstanding friends, one will be motivated and encouraged to move forward as the friends do.
