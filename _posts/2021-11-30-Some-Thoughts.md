I finally retired from Shaw College Resident Student Association. 

I appreciate all the great partners and great friends I met during this journey. I am so grateful that I can have the chance to meet you, to know you and work with you.

I once hold the grand vision and passion of making SCRSA a great organization, I made many plans and think about the path to achieve them all. 

I truly appreciate our SCRSA partners, who gives me supports and together we bring the vision raised by me to reality : he project-X series has go to the sixth season now. And the rough structure of both the overall organization and activity series has been build up.

There are many frustrations that I face due to the conflicts of my major and the time and energy required in my job in SCRSA. I did poor in the past two and a half years in the school. However, I should not regret on that, that is my choice and once my passion and enthusiasm. Though I may probably wake up and find out that all my fascination was just a dream, probably not the best choice at that moment, but it indeed records our youth and our time.  It is the decision I made by myself, so I have nothing to complain about. The worst thing is not that I tried and failed, but you even did not try because you are afraid of failure.

Failure helps us to grow stronger and become better person.

Come on boy: Clear your mind and reset your mood, and move forward on the path you have chosen. We only has one chance to live our life, so we'd better not  make any decisions that will make ourselves regret. Focus and do what you can do and what you should do for the current moment man.

The heart is too noisy, too many sounds, too many worries, and too many emotions. We should clear them all out. I probably know what I should do, but I may fail to do what I suppose to do though.
