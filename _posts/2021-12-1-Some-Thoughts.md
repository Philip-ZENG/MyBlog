### About Decision Making

Being independent and responsible for oneself is to a large extend about how he or she can make decisions that is probably that is "the optimized choice for him or her at the moment". 

However, making decisions and making changes needs courage. Sometimes, and for many of the cases, the ability to make proper decision includes to refuse others and withdraw form anything that will most likely to lead to more damage to you in the future. We need to train our vision and ability to see into the future and make judgments.

This prediction may be correct or may be wrong, this happens, because of the information we used to make the judgment and because of the judging algorithm. But we can train and improve our algorithm when we experience more, lean more and see more, since we have enlarged our training data set and probably increased the quality of the training data.

### About Emotion

It will be great if I can work as a programmed computer, which will not be affected by human emotion, will not feel tired, not afraid of challenges, not delaying things that supposed to be finished in time, and can always do the optimized decision and execute the command timely and efficiently. 

However, emotions are a special aspect of human beings which distinguishes humans from other animals and machines. A human will love another human instead of a machine. The emotion, love, or hate, is a fascinating thing, it probably leads to the prosperity and continuity of human races and civilization, however also leads to conflicts and wars. 

Human is a conflicting entity, on the one hand, being able to be "emotionless" will probably be good for increasing working and studying efficiency (especially when in science and engineering field). However, "emotion" plays an important role in any human society and community if we are looking for cooperations and teamworks. The emotional connections, or say the interpersonal relationship, to a great extend influence people's decision on who they want to work together with. "Emotion" influence whether people fells good when they gets along with each other and whether they would like to form a long term cooperation or like to help each other in the long run. 

It would  be the best if a person can switch flexibly between these two states. On the one hand, one can switch into the "emotionless" mode when they are studying and working, and can switch into a "emotional" mode, full of passion and confidence, and knows how to communicate with others such that a long term partnership can be established and others are willing to help him in the future. This requires a strong sense of self-control and a clear mind about what should be done at the present stage and what is the priority of all the objectives. This also may indicate the ability to make a good balance between studying and socializing, being able to retain focus on certain target in a short period of time.

"Emotional value" is another property that could valued as intelligence. For example, singers, who use their songs to tell a story or share a feeling or their message. This is probably a case of "emotion value" provider. vtuber is another example.

It is often a pity that a person cannot be a master in both of these two fields. A person who expertize in providing "intelligence" value probably may be clumsy in providing "emotional" value, that's not surprising since he or she has always been trained to provide intelligence value during his learning career (in schools). The ability to provide "emotional" value also needs to be trained, but that is probably trained in after school interactions between friends and in the family life.

### About Marriage

"Train your ability is the first thing, and thinking about love is the second", we need to be capable of making a living by ourselves and able to support our family, then we can say that we are ready for a "marriage". 

Finding a girlfriend is probably differ from marriage, but it is also about the exchange and offering of emotional value and economical value (for most of people, is the ability to earn money and contribute to the "partnership"). Investing in ourselves, say education and health, is the most secure way of investment. Since your body and brain will always belong to you and will never betray you. 

We can learn things from studying scientific knowledge,  and we can also learn things from going through a relationship, we could probably learn more and think more about how to "cooperate as partners to run a family", how to help each other and become better self together, how to face difficulties and challenges in life.

So the kind of relationship that is only driven by the desire of sex and the desire of running away from loneliness is not a one that I look forward to, that's too meaningless. A good relationship should be the one that can provides support for each other emotionally, probably economically and in the aspect of intelligence.

On the other hand , marriage is more like making a deal, signing a contract, merging of resources. The two family reached an agreement of merging into one, share their resources and looking forward to a even brighter future and better development. Marriage is realistic, the two family with too diverse situation is not likely to merge into one, if the emotional aspects are not considered as part of the bargaining. We need to do profit prediction and also need to make risk control, that's how a deal is made.
